# Autism_Quiz
An autism self-measurement sheet for teenagers, used in my volunteer program to make the initial diagnosis for teenagers and children.

demo: https://roelno.github.io/

This is a web demo. In reality we build the native test app on tablets and phones for kids. To protect their privacy, only the test features are in the demo, the user and database features are not uploaded and the questions are sampled.
